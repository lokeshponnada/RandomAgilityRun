# com_random_run

A flutter app for generating random sequence QuickFeet commands. Now don't depend on a fitness instructor for nailing those quick feet commands.
Coming UP : Add Timer and TTS which announces the command

# Ambitious Goals : 
1) Track movement to validate it
2) Utilize data from Polar Heart Rate Monitor to generate commands based on current heart rate than at a random rate. A good (ML based) implementation should improve agility.
